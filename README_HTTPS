To get SSL working:

download PCKS7 cert (text) and save it as cert.p7b
dowload the key and save that as text too (key.txt)

then do:
openssl pkcs7 -print_certs -in cert.p7b -out cert.cer // creates PEM certificate
openssl pkcs12 -export -in cert.cer -inkey key-PKCS7.txt -out cert.p12 // creates PCKS12 keystore, which combines both the certificate and the private key

(Password matters! Make it long, as this is the permanent one!)


to convert to Java Key Store, do:

keytool -importkeystore -srckeystore cert.p12 -srcstoretype PKCS12 -destkeystore KeyStore.jks

(Enter the same password 3 times!!! The JKS password must match the key's password, otherwise play won't work by default!)

done, KeyStore.jks is the final Java Key Store to be used with java apps
